# Directional Intensified Feature Descriptor

Feature descriptors encode necessary information into a series of numbers and act as a  numerical ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù that can be used to differentiate one feature from another. It is the fundamental to computer vision applications.

## Description

Feature extraction of our model utilizes "Tri-ocular", "Bi-ocular", and "Dia-ocular" filter for the feature selection. Oxford dataset is used for the feature testing and validation. DITF Model improves the robustness of the model and hence it is proved in terms of Repeatability score.

## Getting Started
## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup
Assuming a fresh [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution, you can install dependencies with:

```shell
conda env create -f Directional Intensified Feature Descriptor.yml
conda activate Directionalintensifiedfeaturedescriptor
## Data
To download and prepare the Oxford dataset, please use the link ([https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/affine/index.html]).
